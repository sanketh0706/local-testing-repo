#TESTING

Just testing to see if all the Git commands are working as expected

#common git commands
  1) git clone ---> To take the code from the remote repository 
  2) git add   ---> To add the changes made to the code
  3) git pull  ---> To pull the code that is to take the previous version of code
  4) git commit --> After adding to stage the changes that is to save the changes
  5) git push  ---> After commit to store the changes in the git repository
  6) git status ---> gives the status that is what are all the files changed or modified and in what branch we are
